This project demonstrates how to create a Power BI dashboard that filters and analyzes Twitter data to display the sum of Total clicks , sum of url clicks , sum of user profile clicks , sum of app installs ,Total engagement metrics etc...

 Tools Used : 

Power BI : For building the interactive dashboard and applying custom DAX functions.
DAX : Used to create calculated columns and measures for custom filtering and aggregating data.
Power Query : For transforming the raw Twitter data and cleaning it for analysis.

 Data Source :

The data used in this project is a CSV file containing Twitter tweet engagement metrics, including:
- Retweets
- Likes
- Impressions
- Tweet time
- Media engagement
- Url clicks
- app installs
- User profile clicks
- app opens
- Media Engagement
- Follows
- Email tweet
- Media views
- id etc...

  Instructions to Run the Project :
  
- Download Data: If you do not have access to the dataset used in the project, you can replace it with your own CSV file structured similarly (containing columns for tweet engagement).

- Open Power BI: Open the Top_Tweets_Engagement_Filter.pbix Power BI file using Power BI Desktop.

- Explore the Dashboard: The dashboard will display various visualizations:
  . Bar charts
  . Pie charts
  . Card
- Interact with Filters: You can use the interactive filters to adjust the view and explore different segments of the Twitter data.

 Learnings :

- Data Transformation: Used Power Query to clean and transform raw Twitter data, including parsing the time column and calculating tweet metrics.
- Custom DAX Functions: Created DAX formulas to apply complex filtering logic for tweet impressions, time, and word count.
- Power BI Visualization: Designed a dashboard to provide clear insights into tweet engagement, helping identify patterns in top-performing content.
